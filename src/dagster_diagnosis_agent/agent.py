# ``openai-agents`` is an optional dependency that provides convenient
# wrappers around the OpenAI function-calling interface.  In production the
# real package will be available, however unit-test environments for this
# repository may not have the dependency installed (network access is
# typically disabled).
#
# To ensure the core library still imports – and therefore allows the test
# suite to run – we fall back to *very* lightweight stub definitions when the
# package is missing.  The stubs implement the small surface-area used by this
# project (``Agent``, ``Runner.run_sync`` and ``set_default_openai_key``).  They
# do **not** attempt to replicate the full behaviour of the real library –
# they only need to be good enough so that importing the module does not raise
# ``ImportError``.
