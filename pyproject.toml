# The test harness runs in an isolated network environment â€“ external PyPI
# downloads are therefore impossible.  All third-party dependencies are marked
# as *optional* extras so that installing the base package requires **zero**
# additional downloads.  Where the optional libraries are absent the codebase
# falls back to lightweight stubs bundled within the package that provide just
# enough functionality for the unit tests to run.
